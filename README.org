Famous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee][Yahtzee dice game]]. The game runs in a terminal and is driven by
the keyboard:

The left part of the game is the scorecard in which a score is written
for each of the 13 categories. The "Bonus" and "Total" lines are
filled automatically when all lines above are filled.

On the top, the current die throw is visible. The title "throw 2/3"
means that 2 throws have been done for a total of 3 allowed before
having to score a category. In the same box, the numbers represent the
values (from 1 to 6) of the five dice. The dice the user wants to keep
(i.e., not throw again) are wrapped in square brackets.

Finally, the "Help" box gives information about the available
shortcuts. The content of this box changes based on the context.

Scoring rules are the same as in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee][the Wikipedia page for Yahtzee]] except
that "Yahtzee bonuses and Joker rules" are not implemented.

** Installation

If you have [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] installed (which is a good idea
anyway), I suggest using it to install hyahtzee2. Otherwise, you can
use [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][Cabal]].

** With Nix
If you have [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] installed, ~cd~ to a [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] clone of the game and do:

#+begin_src text
  ~/projects/hyahtzee2 $ nix-build -A hsPkgs.hyahtzee2.components.exes.hyahtzee2-exe pkgs.nix
  [â€¦]
  ~/projects/hyahtzee2 $ ./result/bin/hyahtzee2-exe
#+end_src


** With Cabal

If you don't have Nix installed or if the previous installation method
failed, you can [[https://www.haskell.org/cabal/][install Cabal]], ~cd~ to a [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] clone of the game and do:

#+begin_src text
  ~/projects/hyahtzee2 $ cabal new-run hyahtzee2-exe
#+end_src
